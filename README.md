## **ANNOUNCEMENT: Canva Library Merging with LidoJS**

Dear Canva users,

We are excited to announce that we are merging the Canva library with LidoJS, a similar project developed by a friend of ours. This merger will allow us to combine our resources and efforts to create a more powerful and user-friendly library for everyone.

As a result of this merger, **Canva will no longer be supported after April 30, 2024**. If you would like to continue using a supported library, you will need to upgrade to LidoJS Pro. LidoJS Pro offers a number of advantages over Canva, including:

-   **More features and functionality**
-   **Regular updates and bug fixes**
-   **Priority support from our team**

**LidoJS Pro is available for $999.** You can learn more about LidoJS Pro at [https://lidojs.com/](https://lidojs.com/).

**For existing Canva users, you will be upgraded to LidoJS Pro for $940.** We understand that this change may be inconvenient for some users, but we believe that it is the best decision for the long-term future of both projects. We appreciate your understanding and continued support.

Sincerely,

The Canva Team
