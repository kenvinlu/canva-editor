/// Bindings should map key names to [command](#commands)-style
/// functions, which will be called with `(EditorState, dispatch,
/// EditorView)` arguments, and should return true when they've handled
/// the key. Note that the view argument isn't part of the command
/// protocol, but can be used as an escape hatch if a binding needs to
/// directly interact with the UI.
///
/// Key names may be strings like `"Shift-Ctrl-Enter"`â€”a key
/// identifier prefixed with zero or more modifiers. Key identifiers
/// are based on the strings that can appear in
/// [`KeyEvent.key`](https:///developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).
/// Use lowercase letters to refer to letter keys (or uppercase letters
/// if you want shift to be held). You may use `"Space"` as an alias
/// for the `" "` name.
///
/// Modifiers can be given in any order. `Shift-` (or `s-`), `Alt-` (or
/// `a-`), `Ctrl-` (or `c-` or `Control-`) and `Cmd-` (or `m-` or
/// `Meta-`) are recognized. For characters that are created by holding
/// shift, the `Shift-` prefix is implied, and should not be added
/// explicitly.
///
/// You can use `Mod-` as a shorthand for `Cmd-` on Mac and `Ctrl-` on
/// other platforms.
///
/// You can add multiple keymap plugins to an editor. The order in
/// which they appear determines their precedence (the ones early in
/// the array get to dispatch first).
